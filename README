This is a basic emulator for a very early, very simple T42.

It is written in Python.

You can run it simply using:

python t42.py

At present, the program is embedded in the file and instructions need to
be manually created by shifting into the right parts of the instruction 
word. 

Todo:

1. Make processors run separate programs
2. Make the construction of programs in assembler possible, separated out
3. Test channels and alternatives properly
4. Restructure so that testing code is separate to classes
5. Probably shitloads more
